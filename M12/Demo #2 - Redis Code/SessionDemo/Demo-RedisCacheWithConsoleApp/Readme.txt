This demo is built referring Rick Rainey's Blog:http://rickrainey.com/2015/02/19/azure-redis-cache/
It has been kept simple to easily explain the concept to the attendees.

Steps:
1. This is a console application which connects to Azure Redis Cache, Add Items, Retrieve Items, etc.
2. Explain the StackExchange Reference from Nuget.
3. Modify the app.config file to replace with your actual hostname and connection key.
4. Build and Execute.
5. Option 4 is to generate load (to be used later to show Monitoring in Azure Portal).
